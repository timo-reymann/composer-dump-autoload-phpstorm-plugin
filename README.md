What the hack is that name?! - I know this name is some what really long, but this was my best idea, so ...

## Whats in the box?
It is simple as its title ;) 

This plugin creates a new autoloader for composer everytime you delete/create/move/copy a file, 
to keep it up to date with your files

## Why?
Otherwise you have to clear it manually or build a custom watcher, this plugin attempts to provide a
throw-in solution for this, that just works(TM).

## How can i use it?
1. Install it from the plugin repository
2. Restart your IDE
3. Setup composer for your project, if it is not already setup
4. You are done, enjoy the magic!
